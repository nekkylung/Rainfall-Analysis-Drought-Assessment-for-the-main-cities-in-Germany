## üìä Analysis Framework

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### 2.1 EDA Component 1: Annual Rainfall Patterns by Climate Type
<img width="3621" height="1702" alt="rainfall_stacked_bar_simplified" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09a1abe6-fc53-4e2e-80f2-3ce5e7e7fae7" />
**Purpose**: Analyze how total annual rainfall varies across different climate types over time.

**Methodology**:
- Aggregates monthly rainfall data to annual totals by city and climate type
- Creates stacked bar charts showing rainfall distribution by climate type
- Applies trend line analysis to identify temporal patterns
- Implements data visualization with value labels for significant rainfall amounts

**Outputs**:
- Stacked bar chart visualization (`rainfall_stacked_bar_simplified.png`)
- Processed data export (`rainfall_stacked_data.csv`)

#### 2.2 EDA Component 2: Seasonal Rainfall Variations

<img width="3557" height="2368" alt="Continental_climate_rainfall" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba14a104-676d-4a8f-b148-c54a4cf41008" />

**Purpose**: Examine seasonal rainfall patterns across different climate types and years.

**Methodology**:
- Maps months to seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn)
- Calculates average rainfall per climate type and season
- Generates statistical benchmarks (mean ¬± standard deviation)
- Creates multi-year seasonal comparison plots

**Key Features**:
- Statistical context with overall mean and standard deviation bands
- Year-over-year seasonal comparison
- Climate-specific analysis for detailed insights
- Professional visualization with comprehensive legends

**Outputs**:
- Climate-specific seasonal plots (e.g., `[Climate_Type]_climate_rainfall.png`)

#### 2.3 EDA Component 3: Drought Index Calculation (SPI)
<img width="1885" height="909" alt="SPI dynamic graph" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bd2c655-3ef6-4ac1-be2f-7de6a1a7e5ae" />

**Purpose**: Implement the Standardized Precipitation Index for comprehensive drought analysis.

**Methodology**: The SPI calculation process includes:
1. **Multi-Scale Analysis**: Calculates SPI for 1, 3, 6, and 12-month time scales
2. **Statistical Modeling**:
   - Fits gamma distribution to precipitation data
   - Accounts for zero precipitation probability
   - Transforms to standard normal distribution
3. **Classification System**: Implements standardized drought/wetness categories
4. **Temporal Processing**: Ensures continuous time series for each city

**SPI Classification Scale**:
- Extremely Wet: ‚â• 2.0 | Extremely Dry: < -2.0
- Very Wet: 1.5 to 2.0 | Severely Dry: -2.0 to -1.5
- Moderately Wet: 1.0 to 1.5 | Moderately Dry: -1.5 to -1.0
- Slightly Wet: 0.5 to 1.0 | Slightly Dry: -1.0 to -0.5
