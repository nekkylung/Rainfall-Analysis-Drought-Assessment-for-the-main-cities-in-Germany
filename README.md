## üîç Overview

This project implements a comprehensive drought assessment framework for major German cities, utilizing advanced statistical methods to transform historical rainfall data into actionable intelligence for water resource management and agricultural planning. The system employs the **Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)** methodology, recognized by the World Meteorological Organization as the standard for meteorological drought monitoring.

## üìä Analysis Framework

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### 2.1 EDA Component 1: Annual Rainfall Patterns by Climate Type
**Purpose**: Analyze how total annual rainfall varies across different climate types over time.

**Methodology**:
- Aggregates monthly rainfall data to annual totals by city and climate type
- Creates stacked bar charts showing rainfall distribution by climate type
- Applies trend line analysis to identify temporal patterns
- Implements data visualization with value labels for significant rainfall amounts

**Outputs**:
- Stacked bar chart visualization (`rainfall_stacked_bar_simplified.png`)
- Processed data export (`rainfall_stacked_data.csv`)

#### 2.2 EDA Component 2: Seasonal Rainfall Variations
**Purpose**: Examine seasonal rainfall patterns across different climate types and years.

**Methodology**:
- Maps months to seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn)
- Calculates average rainfall per climate type and season
- Generates statistical benchmarks (mean ¬± standard deviation)
- Creates multi-year seasonal comparison plots

**Key Features**:
- Statistical context with overall mean and standard deviation bands
- Year-over-year seasonal comparison
- Climate-specific analysis for detailed insights
- Professional visualization with comprehensive legends

**Outputs**:
- Climate-specific seasonal plots (e.g., `[Climate_Type]_climate_rainfall.png`)

#### 2.3 EDA Component 3: Drought Index Calculation (SPI)
**Purpose**: Implement the Standardized Precipitation Index for comprehensive drought analysis.

**Methodology**: The SPI calculation process includes:
1. **Multi-Scale Analysis**: Calculates SPI for 1, 3, 6, and 12-month time scales
2. **Statistical Modeling**:
   - Fits gamma distribution to precipitation data
   - Accounts for zero precipitation probability
   - Transforms to standard normal distribution
3. **Classification System**: Implements standardized drought/wetness categories
4. **Temporal Processing**: Ensures continuous time series for each city

**SPI Classification Scale**:
- Extremely Wet: ‚â• 2.0 | Extremely Dry: < -2.0
- Very Wet: 1.5 to 2.0 | Severely Dry: -2.0 to -1.5
- Moderately Wet: 1.0 to 1.5 | Moderately Dry: -1.5 to -1.0
- Slightly Wet: 0.5 to 1.0 | Slightly Dry: -1.0 to -0.5
- **Near Normal**: -0.5 to 0.5

**Data Products**:
- Comprehensive SPI dataset (`spi_tableau_data.csv`)
- Annual summary statistics (`spi_annual_summary.csv`)
- Distribution analysis by classification category

### 3. Interactive Visualization Dashboard
